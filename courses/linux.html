                <h2 id="what-is-linux">What is Linux?</h2>
                <p>Linux is a free and open-source software that operates on its own operating system. The term 'Linux' stands for GNU + Linux. Initially developed by Linus Torvalds, it was created alongside the source code of Unix. While Linux is extensively utilized for various purposes, its applications are well-known to many.</p>

                <h2 id="use-of-linux">Use of Linux Commands</h2>
                <p>Linux commands are a type of Unix command or shell procedure. They are the basic tools used to interact with Linux on an individual level. Linux commands are used to perform a variety of tasks, including displaying information about files and directories.</p>
                <p>Linux operating system is used on servers, desktops, and maybe even your smartphone. It has a lot of command line tools that can be used for virtually everything on the system.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> If you're looking to set up your own Linux server to practice these commands or host projects, Hostinger can be a great option. Hostinger provides affordable VPS hosting plans with full Linux support, including popular distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.

                <h2 id="common-commands">Most-Commonly Used Linux Commands</h2>
                
                <h3>1. ls command in Linux</h3>
                <p>The ls command is commonly used to identify the files and directories in the working directory. This command is one of the many often-used Linux commands that you should know.</p>
                <div class="command-block">
                    <code>ls</code>
                </div>
                <p>This command can be used by itself without any arguments and it will provide us the output with all the details about the files and the directories in the current working directory. There is a lot of flexibility offered by this command in terms of displaying data in the output.</p>

                <h3>2. pwd command in Linux</h3>
                <p>The pwd command is mostly used to print the current working directory on your terminal. It is also one of the most commonly used commands.</p>

                    <code>pwd</code>
                </div>
                <p>Now, your terminal prompt should usually include the entire directory. If it doesn't, this is a quick command to see which directory you're in. Another purpose for this command is when creating scripts because it can help us find the directory in which the script was saved.</p>

                <h3>3. mkdir command in Linux</h3>

                <div class="command-block">
                    <code>cd directory_name</code>
                </div>

                <div class="command-block">
                    <code>cat file_name</code>
                </div>
